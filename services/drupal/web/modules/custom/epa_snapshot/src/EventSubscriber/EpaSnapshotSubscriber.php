        You have reached the help page for the January 19, 2025 Web Snapshot. This is
        not the current EPA website.

          <a href="https://www.epa.gov">www.epa.gov</a></strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>What is included in the Web Snapshot?</h2>

      <p>
        The Web Snapshot consists of static content, such as webpages and reports in
        Portable Document Format (PDF), as that content appeared on EPA\'s website as
        of January 19, 2025.
      </p>

      <h2>What is not included in the Web Snapshot?</h2>

      <p>
        There are technical limitations to what could be included in the Web Snapshot.
        For example, many of the links from EPA\'s website are to databases that are
        updated with new information on a regular basis. These databases are not part
        of the static content that comprises the Web Snapshot. Links in the Web
        Snapshot to dynamic databases will take you to the current version of the
        database. Searches there will yield the latest data, rather than the data that
        would have been returned for a search conducted on January 19, 2025. Alerts
        should appear when you are leaving the Web Snapshot and linking elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>Contact us and other forms have all been disabled.</p>

      <p>
        Links may have been broken in the website as it appeared on January 19, 2025.
        Those links will appear as broken on the Web Snapshot. Likewise, links which
        may have been working on January 19, 2025 but are now no longer active will
        appear as broken links in the Web Snapshot.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, certain dynamic collections of content were not included in the
        Snapshot due to their size. Those collections remain available on the current
        EPA website at the following links:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          EPA\'s Searchable News Releases: available at
          <a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/search"
            >https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/search</a
